Social Engineering vs Social Networks Privacy

 In light of the prevalence of social engineering attacks that exploit personal information, it is imperative to rethink security features that rely on personal details or interests for account access and password resets. To address this challenge, security questions should be tied to knowledge of non-personal information.

Consider this scenario: You're a CEO or Executive at a coffee shop, engaged in a pleasant conversation with a charming person. As the chat progresses, they inquire about your favorite meal, color, childhood home, sports team, and alma mater. Within minutes, a skilled social engineer has gathered 95% of the answers to common security questions still used by many systems today.

To mitigate this risk, we propose a call to action for security experts to develop new security features that don't depend on personal details. Instead, these features should be based on formal information that is difficult to obtain through casual conversation or social engineering tactics.

By implementing such security measures, we can significantly enhance the protection of our accounts and personal information in today's digital world.

Rather than instructing people to be more cautious with the information they share,  we can devise alternative methods to preserve security that respect individual uniqueness. By doing so, we can ensure that people maintain their human qualities and prevent the weaponization of personal details. This approach allows individuals to engage in conversations without the fear of social engineering tactics while still upholding their privacy.

Security questions are usually used by banks, online services, etc. The purpose of asking such questions is to add another layer of security alongside your password. 2023
CrowdStrike's findings show that 80% of all breaches use compromised identities and can take up to 250 days to identify. Identity-driven attacks are extremely hard to detect. 2024
